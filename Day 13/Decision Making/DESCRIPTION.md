## Challenge

You should develop a program that simulates a role-playing game with a loop of repetition and concatenation. The program should ask for the character's name and then ask the user to choose between `"Attack"` or `"Flee."` If the user chooses an invalid action, the program should display an error message and allow the user to try again

## Input

The program should ask the user to enter the name of the character and the action they should perform (Attack or Flee). The name and action must be entered as a String.

## Output

After receiving the name of the character and the chosen action, the program should display a message stating which action was chosen by the character, concatenating the name of the character with the chosen action. In case of an invalid action, the program should display the error message: `"Please try again"`. See examples below:

## Examples

The table below presents examples with some input data and their respective expected outputs. Be sure to test your program with these examples and other possible cases.

| Input              | Output                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Jubilee,Escape     | Jubilee Chose to Flee!      |
| Elsa Yajin, Attack | Elsa Yajin chose to Attack! |
| Ragnar, Run        | Please try again            |
