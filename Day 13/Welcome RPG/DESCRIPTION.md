## Challenge

You are a beginner programmer who is developing an RPG game for a computer. Before embarking on the adventure, you need to create the character that the player will control throughout the game. To do this, you need to create a program that allows the creation of a character.

> The character should have the following characteristics:

- Name
- Class
- Level

> Your program should prompt the user for the name, class, and level.

## Input

The input should receive the attributes of the character, as shown in the example below:

- `name`: refers to the character's name (`string`).
- `class`: refers to the character's class (`string`).
- `level`: refers to the character's level (`int`).

> **IMPORTANT**: The input should follow the order specified above.

## Output

After receiving the name, class, and level, the program should display a welcome message on the screen, informing the character's name, the chosen class, and level. See the example input below:

```
Kratos
Warrior
55
```

> Based on these input values, the output will look like this:

```
Welcome Warrior Kratos, your level is 55!
```

> **Tip**: Use concatenation to print the sentence

## Examples

The table below provides examples with some input data and their respective expected outputs. Be sure to test your program with these examples and other possible cases.

| Input               | Output                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Kratos, Warrior, 55 | Welcome Archer Bob, your level is 10! |
| Gandalf, Wizard, 88 | Welcome Archer Bob, your level is 10! |
| Bob, 10, Archer     | Welcome Archer Bob, your level is 10! |
