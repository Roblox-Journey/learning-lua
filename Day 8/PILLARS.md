# The Four Pillars of OOP

> OOP is based on four fundamental pillars:

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves the creation of objects that represent real-world entities. In Lua, you create tables that model objects with attributes and methods.

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the idea that the internal details of an object should be hidden from the outside world. In Lua, you can use metatables to define private methods and protect the data of an object.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create new objects based on existing ones. In Lua, this can be achieved by copying tables and extending them.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows different objects to respond differently to the same methods. In Lua, this can be achieved by creating methods with - the same name in different objects.

# Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming in Lua can be implemented simply using **tables** and **metatables** or **through libraries**. The four pillars of OOP **(abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism)** are essential concepts that help organize code efficiently and flexibly.
